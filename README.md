# A test for make a responsive page and store some necessary data

### The process of development

1. On Firday Evening, I start to build the project. In limine, I try to use gulp for create the front page.
	But when I have installed ruby, gem, sass, and gulp on the Windows 10. Run the script of gulp-sass, the terminal always give me some error. Seems to be saying that you can't download the plugin. It's so sad, but I have plan B. I can use *compass + sass*. Coincidentally, I recently read a book about *compass*. It's name is [Sass和Compass设计师指南](http://www.duokan.com/book/69175).
2. In the morning of Saturday, about cost 10 minutes, I set `config.rb` and run `compass watch`. And Then, I 	start to coding. But make a responsive web page, it is more difficult than I think. To start, I will compose Only `Bootstrap`, but recently, I kown another fonter framework `uikit`. It is very similar to Bootstrop, and I think it better to use. So I start to code the responsive page and read the guide. I think it is a challenge.
